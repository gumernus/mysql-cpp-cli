# MySQL C++ Cli

## 📦 Installation
You will need some libraries. Mainly mysql++ but if you are on Debian, you can simply install it with this command:

```
apt-get install libmysql++-dev
```

## ⚙️ Run

If you want to run the program you always need to be in base directory. Then you need to change the mysqlpp::Connection() function in the /src/main.cpp to your database's domain etc.. Then come back to base dir and preform these commands:

```
make
```
```
./bin/out
```
