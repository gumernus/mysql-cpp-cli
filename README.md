# MySQL C++ CLI

## 📦 Installation
You will need some libraries. Mainly mysql++ but if you are on Debian, you can simply install it with this command:

```
$ apt-get install libmysql++-dev
```

## ⚙️ Run
If you want to run the program you always need to be in base directory. Then you need to change the `mysqlpp::Connection()` function in the `./src/main.cpp` to your database's domain etc.. Then come back to base dir and preform these commands:

```
$ sh run.sh
```
